# The SkyLink Chronicles - Airline Management Story

Welcome to DataStream Airlines, where I'm Captain Linked List, the solo pilot of this data-driven airline!

Each flight forms a perfect linked list node, connected in sorted order across the digital skies. 
Passengers are organized in alphabetical trees, while flight routes map as weighted graphs.

When you book, Hash Map agents find your reservation instantly with O(1) magic!
Boarding follows Queue principles - first in, first to fly.

Luggage stacks up LIFO style, and emergency flights rise to the top of our priority heap.
Airports connect as vertices in our grand flight network graph.

I navigate through arrays of schedules, balancing crew trees, and linking destinations.
Every data structure has its role in keeping our flights perfectly sorted and connected!
